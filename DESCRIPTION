Description: Recursive partitioning based on psychometric models,
  employing the general MOB algorithm (from package partykit) to obtain
  Bradley-Terry trees, Rasch trees, rating scale and partial credit trees, and
  MPT trees, trees for 1PL, 2PL, 3PL and 4PL models and generalized partial 
  credit models.
